Course Syllabus for "BUS303: Strategic Information Technology"
--------------------------------------------------------------

[BUS206](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bus206/) introduced you to the
subject of Management Information Systems (MIS). The focus of that
initial course was on the nuts and bolts of information systems: how
they work, how you create them, how to secure them, and so on. This
course is developed to help you understand how information technology
can be used as part of an organization’s overall strategy. In this
course you will focus on the allocation and use of technology resources
across an entire firm as part of the larger organizational strategy.
Because firms do not have an unlimited supply of capital, they must
decide when and where to deploy new information technology. Firms must
not only focus on *when* to deploy IT, but also *if* they should deploy
IT at all! This brings up the bigger question about technology: Can the
use of IT bring a sustainable competitive advantage to an organization?
There are those who say, “No”; and others who say, “Of course!”  You
will explore the differing opinions out there on this topic in unit 1.
In unit 2 you will delve into how IT might manage business processes and
take a look at Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, Business
Process Management (BPM) systems, and business process reengineering.
You will then move on to how technology can inform decision making in
unit 3 by studying business intelligence, data warehousing, and data
mining. Unit 4 introduces you to the world of e-commerce and examines
such important topics as intellectual property and online marketing. In
unit 5 you will explore major trends in technology today like cloud
computing, Web 2.0, and mobile technologies. Units 1 through 5 lay the
groundwork for understanding how IT can be used in business strategy,
which you will put to practical use in unit 6 where you will focus on
how to actually write a strategy.

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. A
key point to remember is that this is a course on strategy and how it
relates to information technology.  
    
 Besides reviewing these materials, you will also need to complete:  

-   Unit 6 “Develop Your Own Social Media Strategy” Assignment
-   The Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the readings and assignments listed above.  
    
 In order to pass this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on

help you plan your time accordingly. It may be useful to take a look at
these time advisories to determine how much time you have over the next
few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for yourself. For
example, unit 1 should take you 16 hours. Perhaps you can sit down with
your calendar and decide to complete subunits 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 (a total
of 2 hours) on Monday night; subunits 1.1.3 and 1.1.4 (a total of 2.5
