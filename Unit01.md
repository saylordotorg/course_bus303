**Unit 1: Information Technology and Competitive Advantage** <span
id="1"></span> 
*Organizations have been using information technology for the past
50-plus years. Billions of dollars have been spent on computer hardware,
software, network communications, and all the other requirements of
having world-class technology. But to what end? Has the money spent on
technology allowed businesses to become more profitable? Or more
specifically: has the implementation of information technology led to a
sustainable competitive advantage?*  
              
 **This unit will start by answering the question: What is information
technology?  For that matter, what exactly is technology? For our
purposes here, technology is considered any electronic or digital tool
used by people to make a process easier or more efficient. You can also
think of technology as the science of creating or using technical
objects in order to reach industrial goals, which certainly applies to
how businesses use technology to achieve productivity. We tend to think
of technology mostly in terms of electronic innovation. Information
technology is defined as those digital or electronic tools that are
designed to make the process of managing or distribution of information
easier.**  
                
 **You will then study the history of IT and how it fits into business
strategy today. Specifically, you will review concepts from other
courses, such as the value chain and Porter’s Five Forces of Competitive
Advantage. You will look at how IT fits into these topics and other key
concepts related to strategy.**  
  
 *This unit will end with a focus on the relationship between IT and
competitive advantage, which will set the foundation for the rest of the
course. Is it possible for IT to bring competitive advantage? Many argue
that YES, it can! As a student of information systems, it is highly
important that you can articulate both Carr’s article AND the rebuttals
to it. The articles below present different cases for how IT can bring a
competitive advantage. See if you can find a common thread in these
articles.*
